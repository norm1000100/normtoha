<h1>My Fall From Gardening Grace</h1>
<p>
Well well well. Looks like I got myself into a pickle... or a cucumber? doesn't matter. I like gardening, I like automation, I hate always watering and taking care of my plants(seems odd given that I like gardening but don't yell at me). Looks like I'll have to automate the process and make it open source for good measure.
